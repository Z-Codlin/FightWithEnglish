	Didi said it plans to offer a roaming services from next month so that Chinese visitors can enjoy ride sharing services while traveling in Australia.

The company said that this new move will also bring extra income for local drivers and boost the regional tourist economy.
	It has officially set up its Australia and New Zealand(ANZ) headquarters in Melbourne,while university researchers from around Australia are already taking part in its artificial
 intelligence research initiatives.
	Didi's own-branded private car-hailing service was launched in Mexico and Australia earlier this year.

2.<Birth rate set to continue decline,despite two child policy>
	The number of births in China is expected to continue to fall this year,
the third year of the implementation of a national policy designed to encourage
couples to have a second child,according to president of the China Population Association.
	"The number of peoole born will undoubtedly continue to fall this year,
as well as over the next few years," Zhai Zhenwu, who is also a prominent professor
in population studies in Renmin University of China, said.
	Zhai, president of the China Population Association, said a major reason for the
declining birth rate is the rapidly decreasing number of wowen of childbearing age,
which has kept going down by between 5 million and 6 million every year.
	"So even if the birth ratio remains the same, the total number of people born will
keep decreasing," he said.
	Another reason for the expected decline of births is that many women who planned to
have a second child rushed to get pregnant and give birth in the first serval years of
the implementation of the policy, and the peak in births will be over soon, Zhai said.
	However, Zhai said the universal second child policy has helped to increasing the
birth rate, and the number of second children born in China has accounted for about half
of all the births in China last year.
	"Without the universal second child policy, the number of births would see a more
drastic fall," he said.
	Zhai suggested creating a more friendly environment for couples to give birth, such 
as establishing more nurseries for infants, to encourage the birth of a second child.
	"However, we should realize the fact that various meansures designed to encourage
births will not stop the dwindling birth rate, as experiences in some developed countries
such as Japan and South Korea have shown," he said.

to have a carraying capability  of 3 to 4.5 tons for sun-synchronous orbit, and a launch capability
for low-Earth orbit and geosynchronous transfer orbit.
#根据中国航天院的设计，长征8号到同日轨道的载重能力将达3到4.5吨。近地轨道~
	With moderate cost, a short launch preparation cycle and adaptability to conditions of different
launch sites, the rocket will be very competitive in the commercial satellite launch market , said Song.

4.<Experts suggest law change to deter attacks on bus drivers>
	Legal experts in China have called for tougher penalties for passengers who endanger public safety
by disturbing or attacking bus drivers, with some suggesting a law revision might be needed to stamp
out the problem.
	The Supreme People's Court organized a seminar for lawyers, judges and researchers in Beijing last
week to discuss a fatal crash in Chongqing on Oct 28 in which a bus plunged from a bridge into the Yangtze River.
	Footage from the vehicle's data recorder showed a female passenger hitting the bus driver seconds
before the accident. Thirteen people died and two others are still missing.
	The accident sparked discussion nationwide on how transportation authorities, companies and lawmakers
can prevent attacks on bus drivers, which, although rare, have become a major concern for public in recent weeks.
	Yu Haisong, deputy director of the SPC's Research Office, said the penalties for such behavior should be clearlyh defind.
	"China's Criminal Law should play its role in protecting people and in punishing those who seriously
endanger public safety," he said. "A definition of this kind of violent obstruction of sate driving,
as well as punishment offenders can face, should be clarified in law."
	Lin Wei, vice-president of of the University of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, agreed and added
that causing harm to a public transportation driver is more serious than other dangerous behaviors,
particularly if a vehicle in moving, "so the punishment must be heavier."
	Hu Yunteng, a senior SPC judge, said the offense should be added in Criminal Law, with tougher penalties
guaranteed for passengers who obstruct drivers while on expressways or bridges.
	As a draft law revision can take time, several experts suggested the SPC release guidelines or a judicial
interpretation to help judges handle similar cases.
